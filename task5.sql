Popular Categories by City
A small e-commerce team wants to know which product categories are popular in each city. A category is considered "popular" in a city if at least 2 different customers from that city have placed orders in that category.

Write a query to return the following:

The city name as city
The product category
The number of unique customers who ordered in that city-category as unique_customers
The total number of orders in that city-category as total_orders
Additionally, the query should:

Only include city-category groups with at least 2 unique customers (use HAVING)
Sort the results by unique_customers in descending order, then by city ascending, then by category ascending
Notes:

You can use COUNT(DISTINCT ...) to count unique customers within each group.
Check the 001_up.sql file to see the schema and sample data.
Expected column order:

city, category, unique_customers, total_orders

SELECT
    cities.name as city,
    products.category,
    count(DISTINCT(customers.id)) as unique_customers,
    count(orders.id) as total_orders
FROM orders
JOIN cities on cities.id = customers.city_id
JOIN products on products.id = orders.product_id
JOIN customers on customers.id = orders.customer_id
GROUP BY city, products.category
HAVING (unique_customers >= 2)
ORDER BY unique_customers DESC, city, category
